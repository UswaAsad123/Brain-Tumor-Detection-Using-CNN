# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN
Project Description: Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN
The Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN project aims to develop a convolutional neural network model that can accurately identify brain tumors in MRI images. This automated system enhances the diagnostic process by providing quick and reliable tumor detection, reducing the reliance on manual image analysis by healthcare professionals.

Methodology
The project utilizes a dataset of labeled MRI images, categorized into two classes: images with tumors and images without tumors. A CNN is trained on this dataset, learning to extract features and patterns associated with each class. The images are preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and converting them to RGB format.

Results
After training, the model is evaluated on unseen MRI images, demonstrating effective tumor detection capabilities. This project showcases the potential of deep learning in improving medical diagnostics and patient outcomes.
